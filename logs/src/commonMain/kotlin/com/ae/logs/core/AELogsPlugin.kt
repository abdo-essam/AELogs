/**
 * Base interface for all AELogs plugins.
 *
 * Plugins provide modular, isolated functionality to AELogs.
 * Both [UIPlugin] (with Compose UI) and [DataPlugin] (headless) extend this.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 * ```
 * install() → onAttach() → onStart() → onOpen() ⇄ onClose() → onStop() → onDetach()
 * ```
 *
 * | Callback | Trigger                                         |
 * |----------|-------------------------------------------------|
 * | onAttach | Plugin registered with AELogs (once)           |
 * | onStart  | Host app moved to foreground                    |
 * | onOpen   | AELogs UI panel opened                         |
 * | onClose  | AELogs UI panel closed                         |
 * | onStop   | Host app moved to background                    |
 * | onDetach | Plugin unregistered (once)                      |
 * | onClear  | User requested a data wipe                      |
