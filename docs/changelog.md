## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-XX

### Added
- 🎉 Initial stable release `v1.0.0`
- Extracted features into specialized independent plugins (`:log-network`, `:log-analytics`)
- Built-in `LogPlugin` with search, severity filtering, and copy features
- Material3 themed UI with light/dark mode support and `AELogUiConfig` overrides
- Shared standard UI components (`PanelHeader`, `LogSearchBar`, `LogFilterChips`)
- Adaptive layout: bottom sheet (phones) / dialog (tablets)
- Configurable floating debug button and multi-finger long-press triggers
- Expanded Request/Response details view with JSON payloads in `NetworkPlugin`
- FlowRow property chips in `AnalyticsPlugin`
- Safe global static APIs (`AELog.i`, `NetworkRecorder`, `AnalyticsTracker`)

### Architecture
- fully reactive `Model-Store-API-UI` pattern
- Idempotent thread-safe plugin mapping via `AELogSetup.init()`
- Replaced global mutable states with strictly managed `StateFlow` scopes
- Removed `reified` generic JVM restrictions for better multiplatform compatibility
- Switched default `Instant` logic to Standard library `Clock.System` for platform consistency
